# GitLab Dynamic Environments

##     Jenkins Pipeline - Deploy to Dynamic Environment
You will learn how to **simulate deployment to dynamic environments with tags**.

pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        INSITITUTE_NAME = "Pathnex"
        TEAM = "DevOps"
    }
    parameters {
        string(name: 'ENVIRONMENT', defaultValue: 'dev', description: 'Deployment Environment')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh "echo "Deploying $INSITITUTE_NAME app to $ENVIRONMENT for $TEAM team"'
            }
        }
    }
}

##    GitLab CI - Dynamic Environment Deployment
You will learn how to **use GitLab dynamic environment names with realistic tags**.

stages:
  - deploy

variables:
  INSITITUTE_NAME: "Pathnex"
  TEAM: "DevOps"

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  image: alpine:latest
  environment:
    name: $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
    url: http://$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME.pathnex.com
  script: 
    - echo "Deploying $INSITITUTE_NAME app to $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME for $TEAM team"
